# Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets
## Challenge Kaggle
### Competition Description
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. 
### Goal 
In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.

### Acknowledgments
This dataset was created by the company figure-eight and originally shared on their ‘Data For Everyone’ website here.
